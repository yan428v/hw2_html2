            Black tea
        </a>
        is one of the most widely consumed teas globally. <br>
        It undergoes full oxidation during processing, which gives it a robust flavor and dark color. <br>
        Popular varieties include Assam, Darjeeling, and Earl Grey. <br>
        Black tea is known for its boldness and is often enjoyed with or without milk and sugar. <br>
        It's a comforting choice for many tea enthusiasts, offering a rich and invigorating experience.

            Green tea</a>
        revered for its health benefits, is minimally processed, preserving its natural color <br>
        and antioxidants. With origins in China, Japan, and other Asian countries, <br>

        grassy taste and a lighter color. Often consumed without additives, green tea is celebrated <br>
        for its delicate flavor profile and potential health-promoting properties.

            White tea</a>
        may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally <br>
        feature young or minimally processed leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.<br>
        Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white tea and very little international<br>
        agreement; some sources use the term to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing,<br>
        some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly before the buds have fully<br>
        opened and allowed to wither and dry in natural sun, while others include tea buds and very<br>
        young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying.<br>
